# Product promotion site for furniture companies

### ðŸ”Ž In this project, I made html sites dynamic using the template engine, tried to design the front of the page using bootstrap, increased my nodejs express library command and performed crud operations using mongodb. Apart from these, the most difficult part of the project for me was updating the product images. I got over this situation using jquery.

#### :white_check_mark: In this project, there is an admin panel so that the owner of the site can add, update and delete their products.For this, user-accessible areas are restricted. On the other hand, the user can view the products by category. Also you can send a message to the site owner from the contact section.

##### Technologies and Frameworks I use:


 :ballot_box_with_check: Back-end: NodeJs

 :ballot_box_with_check: Front-end: Html template and ejs for template engine

 :ballot_box_with_check: Database: MongoDB for NoSQL Database

 :ballot_box_with_check: Frameworks: Express, Mongoose, Bootstrap, Jquery
